# Ticket Bot

Discord Ticket Bot For FiveM RP Server!
Discord.js Version: 14.7.1
Give Credits :)

Same code used in EliteX Roleplay with some changes and modification!

Also note than this code contains more junks. Just use what you want and remove you don't. 

This is not the code I use in Iconic Roleplay (Tamil), it is totally different with the same logic!

This repository won't be recieving any major updates! Only bug fixes. I think, I have covered almost everything that is needed for Roleplay server!
