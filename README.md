# Ticket Bot

## Introduction
This is a Discord ticket bot for a FiveM RP server, inspired by EliteX Roleplay with modifications. It uses Discord.js version 14.7.1.

Please note that this code may contain unnecessary elements, so feel free to remove anything you don't need. This is not the exact code used in Iconic Roleplay (Tamil), but it follows a similar logic with similar functionality.

Important: This repository will only receive bug fixes and will not have major updates. I believe it includes most of the essential features needed for a Roleplay server. However, feel free to make further adjustments based on your requirements.
